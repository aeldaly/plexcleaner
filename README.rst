**Require python >= 2.7**

This application will read the content of a Plex Media Server database and will generate a new library, composed of the same
files, with suggested directory, filename, and jaket for each media. The application use the metadata generated by matching movies with agent in the Plex Media Server.
This application rely on a working ``sqlite3`` database found in the Plex Media Server directory tree to fetch information about files
contained in the media library folder. If a file has default value as metadata, the application will assume that the media file was not correctly
matched by Plex. Therefore, the application will not process that particular file.

Note
----
Plex Database is usually set with ``rw-r--r--`` permissions and has group and owner set with ``plex`` user. You can run this script as the ``plex`` user or as ``root`` but you will need to ``chmod`` the database file with ``774``.
